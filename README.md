# Changes Made and Code Fixes
With these changes and code fixes, Java code for calculating x^y without using library functions is now in a more organized and functional state. The associated JUnit tests are running successfully, validating the correctness of the code logic. Overall, the codebase has been significantly improved in terms of readability, adherence to Java conventions, and robustness.

## Changes Made
- Refactored variable names to adhere to Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables and methods).
- Ensured consistent indentation throughout the codebase for better readability.
- Updated the JUnit test methods to follow naming conventions and accurately test the code logic.
- Fixed the issue causing the tests to not run by ensuring proper setup and configuration of JUnit in the Gradle build file.
- Improved overall code structure and readability.
